# separateSkinnedMesh
Separated and cobined skinned mesh with preserve or skin.

How it works

For separate:
1. Set name for new object. 
2. Select the required faces of the original object.
3. Set checkBox "delete from origin" if you want to extract these faces from the original object. 
4. Push "Separate skinned mesh" button - the separated mesh will be added to the "generated_mesh" group in the scene. A skinCluster will be added to this new object and its SkinWeights from the original object will be copied. 

For combine:
1. Set name for new object.
2. Select the needed objects.
3. Push "Combune skinned mesh"  - the combined mesh will be added to the "generated_mesh" group in the scene. A skinCluster will be added to this new object and its SkinWeights from the original object will be copied.

Once you've finished editing the skinned mesh, manipulate the scene and its objects as you wish.
